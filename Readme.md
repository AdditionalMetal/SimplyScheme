# Simply Scheme

My (on-going) solutions to Brian Harvey's [*Simply
Scheme*](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~bh/ss-toc2.html) which is
hopefully a gentle slope to
[SICP](https://sarabander.github.io/sicp/).

## Installation

I've included a quick (likely broken) bash script to install the
minimal environment for my desktop (Ubuntu 22.04) to do the
exercises.

_(The script is junk, but it may enough to get you up and running.)_

## Better Solutions

I started this repo unaware that [buntime](https://github.com/buntine)
had done the same thing about 15 years earlier. His (much better)
solutions (and various forks) can be found on
[github](https://github.com/buntine/Simply-Scheme-Exercises).

Most importantly, his
[README.md](https://github.com/buntine/Simply-Scheme-Exercises) has
directions for getting [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/) to work with
Simply Scheme.

The main text is under copyright from MIT Press but freely available
